[ ] insert components from text (maybe just markers)
[ ] load styles from those files (mostly complete, just need to double check)
[ ] ability to insert into ui nodes (like adding buttons for different types)
[ ] maybe change system like interactions could be used for buttons instead of reading events every frame (then we could use said marker components)
[ ] when a ui element is spawned as a root, make sure it has its own root panel (centered 100% 100% blank empty panel)


[ ] text input
[ ] scroll areas
[ ] maybe for buttons we could have an easier way of having different hover/pressed colors


[ ] ability to add text straight onto buttons to automate child creation
[ ] optionally allow for an array to be given instead of single root element for easier UI creation (will be useful with editor as well)
